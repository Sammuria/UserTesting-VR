Thank you for purchasing Motion Heatmap Analyzer.

All platforms supported.

The asset is prepared to be easy to apply and use in any Unity project.
You can use it for three different formats: webcam, video and unity camera for a 3d scene.

• Webcam format: ready to analyze movement of objects or people in real time using webcam. You can get the most out of using it on mobile devices, such as smartphones.

• Video format: you can use any video format compatible with unity (using the Unity video player gameObject) and analyze the movement of the imported footage.

• Unity Cam format: you can analyze the movement of gameObjects in a scene through the unity camera.

The gradient colors for motion visualization are editable. There are two modes of detection: light contrast or color change.
